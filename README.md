# Recordstore: Simple boilerplate for React.js

### What is the idea?

Create a template for React.js applications avoiding `create-react-app` tool. This is journey to understand how React.js applications are setting up from scratch.

### My Guide

I have read (really I'm reading yet) about how [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), [babel](https://babeljs.io/) and [eslint](https://eslint.org/) works, motivated by this guide: [Nathan Sebhastian's Post](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-set-up-deploy-your-react-app-from-scratch-using-webpack-and-babel-a669891033d4)
